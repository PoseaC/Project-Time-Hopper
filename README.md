# Project-Time-Hopper

Project Time Hopper is a mobile game about a cybernatic rabbit with time altering powers trying to escape from a laboratory. The rabbit could slow down time or rewind it to solve different chambers of puzzels

The game idea was scrapped as I didn't find the game as fun to play as I thought it would be when I first thought of the concept.
